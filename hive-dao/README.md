# Hive DAO

## Mission

Empower people who feel hesitant to trying out Web 3.0 by providing self-sovereign DAO technology focused on privacy, and permissioned access.

## Goals

1. Building Hives.
2. Hive is a safe space for experimentation.
    1. What happens in a Hive is not public by default.
    2. Joining a Hive requires an invitation from a Hive member.
    3. Each new member has to be approved by one of the Hive Gate Keepers.
